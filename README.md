# ENSE 374 Group Project
ENSE 374 group project by group 9.

Under the theme of eHealth, group 9 created a command-line based application for
tracking alerts and notifications, and managing doctor's appointments. The application is by no means intended for real-world use and is just a simplified model for the purpose of studying agile development using the Scrum methodology, OOP principles, and collaboration with multiple team members.

Name the project, set the `Location` of the project or keep the default, and navigate to the directory of the project in the system explorer.  

Move the `src/ ` folder from this repository and merge it with the `src/ `
directory where you created the project.  

The project files should now be visible in the IDE's `Package Editor`. If not, press `F5` with the `Package Editor` highlighted to refresh the directories.  

Press `Ctrl + F11` to build and run, or `F11` to build and debug.  

You may receive a window to choose how to run the application. Select `Java Application`.

Click `Next`, `Next`, name the project, and `Finish`.  

Move the `src/ ` folder from this repository and merge it with the `src\ `
directory where you created the project.  

Then, open the `Project` tab on the left, and expand the root folder.

Expand `src/com/Main `. In the editor window, click the green play button beside `public class Main`. There, you can choose to either run or debug the program.
